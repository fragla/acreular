Description: The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) and the European League Against 
    Rheumatism (EULAR) individually and collaboratively have produced diagnositic
    classification criteria for a range of different rheumatic diseases. The acreular 
    package brings together methods for calculating these measures into a single package. 
    Additionally, a shiny web tool is included to enable the calculation and visualisation 
    of different scores via a web browser using criteria stored in CSV or Excel files.
